## Description

The Employee Tracker is a company management system to view, edit, create and delete employees, managers, departments and roles in a database. The user can track the budget of each department as well.

*NOTE: this project is still in work. Many features like adding and deleting employees are not implemented yet.*

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo to your local device.
2. Run *npm i* in the root folder to download node dependencies.
3. Using MySQL Workbench, run the schema & seed data located in /db/schema.sql and /db/seeds.sql. (Because you cannot add employees as of 3/22, you must use seed data)
4. Run "node index.js" in the command line to view the main menu.
